The Road Repair and Tracking System is a web application that allows users to report road issues such as potholes, cracks, and other road damages. The system will then track the status of the reported road issues and provide updates to the users. This project is being undertaken as part of the Software Engineering course at NIT Rourkela by [Ashish Padhy](https://github.com/Shurtu-gal).

## Features
